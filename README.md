### 👋 Hi, I'm Shea.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on analyzing some Metacritic review data.
- 🌱 Lately, I've been focused on learning more about game design and development (C# and Unity).
- 💬 I'm a data analyst (SQL, R, Python 🐍, Tableau). I know a fair amount about healthcare fraud 🏥.
- ✨ Fun facts: I like to knit. 🧶 I love mushrooms. 🍄 I'm a bit of a Trekkie. 🌌🖖

I'd be glad to collaborate on indie game development projects and analytics projects for a good cause (e.g. healthcare inequality, criminal justice reform, food security, climate activism, animal rights).
