### 👋 Hi, I'm Shea.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on analyzing some Metacritic review data.
- 🌱 I’m always learning a lot of things but mostly I am focused on data engineering and game design/development (C# and Unity).
- 💬 I'm a data analyst (SQL, R, Python 🐍, Tableau). I know a fair amount about healthcare fraud 🏥.
- ✨ Fun facts: I like to knit. 🧶 I love mushrooms. 🍄 My favorite TV show is Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. ⭐
